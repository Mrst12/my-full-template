# My very first website with Code Institute

Welcome! [Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## Learning to use cards

The first page of this project was a walkthrough project, displaying cards with an image, and clickable link,to show the technologies we were going to use in the course.
The first two examples of images and clickable links were walked through, and how to navigate throught he different pages. Stream-two and stream-three were done by myself.
